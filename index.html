        <h1>What I've learned from</h1>
        <div id="line"></div>
        <p>1. Keep going, never give up.</p>
        <p>2.Panic drowns thought.</p>
        <p>3. Dont assume anything.</p>
        <p>4. Think before you act.</p>
        <p>5. Details make the diffrence</p>
        <p>6. Just because the rules don't make sense to you doesn't mean that they dont make sense.</p>
        <p>7. Figuring out the rules turns them from enemies into friends.</p>
        <p>8. Be grateful for what you have.</p>
        <p>9. It's not wisdom that counts but wisdom under pressure.</p>
        <p>10. Too much confidence can be as dangerous as having none at all.</p>
        <p>11. Take life in steps.</p>
        <p>12. Friends keep you sane.</p>
        <p>13. Conserve your resources.</p>
        <p>14. Tabtrums never help.</p>
        <p>15. Nothing clears the mind like sheep.</p>
        <p>16. When looking for solutions, beating yourself up isn't one of them.</p>
        <p>17. Dont dwell on mistakes, learn from them.</p>
        <p>18. Great risk can come with great reward.</p>
        <p>19. Fear can be conqured. Anxiety must be endured.</p>
        <p>20. Courage is a full-time job.</p>
        <p>21. When the world changes, you've got to change with it.</p>
        <p>22. Always be aware of your surroundings.</p>
        <p>23. There's nothing wrong with careful curiosity.</p>
        <p>24. Take care of your environment, so it can take care of you.</p>
        <p>25. Just beacuse somyone looks like you doesn't automatically make them a friend.</p>
        <p>26. Just beacuse somyone doesn't like you doesn't automatically make them an enemy.</p>
        <p>27. Everything comes at a price. Especially if that price is your conscience.</p>
        <p>28. It's not failure that matters, it's how you recover</p>
        <p>29. When you're trying to tell yourself something, listen.</p>
        <p>30. Questions don't stay put; you can't just walk away from them.</p>
        <p>31. Never put off the boring but important chores.</p>
        <p>32. Sometimes you have to compromise an ideal in order to save it.</p>
        <p>33. Books make the world bigger.</p>
        <p>34. Revenge hurts only you.</p>
        <p>35. Knowledge, like a seed, needs the right time to bloom.</p>
        <p>36. Growth doesn't come from a comfort zone, but from leaving it.</p>
